"""
class contextlib.ExitStack
A context manager that is designed to make it easy to programmatically 
combine other context managers and cleanup functions, especially those that are
 optional or otherwise driven by input data.
 
enter_context(cm)

Enters a new context manager and adds its __exit__() method to the callback stack. 
The return value is the result of the context manager’s own __enter__() method.

push(exit)

Adds a context manager’s __exit__() method to the callback stack.
The passed in callback is returned from the function, allowing this method to be used as a function decorator.

callback(callback, *args, **kwds)

Accepts an arbitrary callback function and arguments and adds it to the callback stack.
Unlike the other methods, callbacks added this way cannot suppress exceptions 
(as they are never passed the exception details).
The passed in callback is returned from the function, allowing this method to be used as a function decorator.

pop_all()

Transfers the callback stack to a fresh ExitStack instance and returns it. No callbacks are invoked by this operation 
- instead, they will now be invoked when the new stack is closed 
(either explicitly or implicitly at the end of a with statement).

close()

Immediately unwinds the callback stack, invoking callbacks in the reverse order of registration.
For any context managers and exit callbacks registered, the arguments passed in will indicate 
that no exception occurred.
