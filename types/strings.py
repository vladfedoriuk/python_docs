#Strings:

# If you don’t want characters prefaced by \ to be interpreted
# as special characters, you can use raw strings by adding an r
# before the first quote:

print("C:\some\name")  # here \n means newline!
print(r'C:\some\name')

#String literals can span multiple lines.
# One way is using triple-quotes: """...""" or '''...'''

print("""\

#Strings can be concatenated (glued together)
# with the + operator, and repeated with *:

print("3*'un' +'ium'= ", 3*'un' +'ium')

#Strings can be indexed (subscripted), with the first
# character having index 0.
# There is no separate character type;
# a character is simply a string of size one:

word = 'Python'
print('word = ', word)
print('word[0] = ', word[0])
print('word[5] = ', word[5])
print('word[-1] = ', word[-1])
print('word[-6] = ', word[-6])

# While indexing is used to obtain individual characters,
# slicing allows you to obtain substring:

print('word[:2]+word[2:] = ', word[:2]+word[2:])
print('word[0:2] = ', word[0:2]) # characters from position 0 (included) to 2 (excluded)
print('word[2:5] = ', word[2:5]) # characters from position 2 (included) to 5 (excluded)

# s[:i] + s[i:] is always equal to s:
print('word[:4] + word[4:] = ',  word[:4] + word[4:])

#Python strings cannot be changed — they are immutable.
# Therefore, assigning to an indexed position in the string
